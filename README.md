# BIFPIM-erratum
Erratum for Gustafson (2015), Bayesian Inference for Partially Identified Models: Exploring the Limits of Limited Data, Chapman and Hall / CRC Press

Bottom of p. 27: Two instances of max{0+q-r+1} should be max{0, q+r-1}.  (As is correct earlier on p. 21.)  {Posted 2024-12-10.  Thanks to a reader for flagging.}

p. 30:  The content (but not the caption) of Fig 2.3 is erroneously a repeat of Fig 2.2.    Here is the [intended content](fig2dot3-intended.pdf).  {Posted 2024-12-10.}
